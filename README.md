# DDAP Strategy Simulation
This project aims to create an algorithm using Google Sheets and AppScript to track a given financial instrument day by day and compare its performance with the maximum price (which is updated when a new maximum is reached).

According to this strategy, with every drop ranging from -5% to -70% you enter the market with a portion of liquid capital to be able to take advantage of this temporary drop.

Obviously the comparison with a CAP (Capital Accumulation Plan) or a CIP (Capital Investment Plan) does not hold up, the general rule is CIP > CAP > DDAP.

This strategy, however, can be useful to all those who invest month by month and do not feel confident in putting in the entire amount but want to enter the market with a small part of what is usually allocated to the CAP
